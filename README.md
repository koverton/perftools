# Solace perftools

Just a general workspace in which I prototype various tools for high-performance tests or eventing.

Some examples:

* perfADTest: a high-performance C program to test event latency while varying event rate, size, etc.
* msgTrace: a high-performance C program to listen for events and dump them to a memory-mapped file; 
    related programs are logRead and dumpIndex
